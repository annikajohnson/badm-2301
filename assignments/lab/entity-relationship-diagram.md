# Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) Lab Assignment

Reference [Database Design notes](https://github.com/gwu-business/istm-4121/blob/master/notes/database-design.md#instructional-modules).

## Description

Work in project groups. Choose a [business prompt example](https://github.com/gwu-business/istm-4121/tree/master/resources/group-project/examples),
 or use the content of your [midterm pitch](/assignments/group-project/midterm-pitch.md).

Given existing information system planning and analysis, design a database to store system data.

Translate business logic and information requirements into database concepts. Identify Entities and Relationships within the scope of your system, then draw an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to communicate the concepts in visual form.

### Expectations

Your ERD should:

 + communicate with clarity the logical and physical database design
 + have a title
 + use proper terminology
 + represent all entities, and for each:
   + represent any known or likely attributes
 + represent all relationships between entities, and for each:
   + describe the relationship in English, for each direction
   + denote relationship cardinality, for each direction
   + optionally denote relationship optionality, for each direction
 + communicate stated assumptions in a text box footer as necessary
