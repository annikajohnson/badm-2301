 + [WordPress DC](http://www.meetup.com/wordpressdc/)
 + [DC Tech](http://www.meetup.com/DC-Tech-Meetup/)
 + [DC Ruby Users Group](http://www.meetup.com/dcruby/)

> Please add your own recommended groups to this list!

Write a short (1-2 page) summary of your experiences, to address the following questions:

 + Which events did you attend, which groups hosted them, and what happend at each?
 + What, if anything did you learn about contemporary industry challenges and practices?
 + For each meetup group... Have you returned to attend subsequent events hosted by this group? Would you recommend the group to a friend? Why or why not?

You may attach or embed photos to your writeup to provide further evidence of event attendance.
