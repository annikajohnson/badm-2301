# Systems Analysis

Identify **three** real-world information systems. Two should be high-tech (web or mobile-based) systems. One should be a non-tech or low-tech system.

Identify the information inputs and outputs of each system.

Identify the purpose of each system. What business value or advantage does it bring to its creator? What value does it bring to its users?

Identify and analyze a few processes employed by each system. Which processes work well? Which ones need improvement, and how might they be improved?

Describe the user interface of each system. How do humans interact with the system?

If possible, describe the data storage mechanisms for each system. Does the system discard its data or does it retain it?

If possible and applicable, describe the hardware and software that power each system.

Finally, contrast the three different systems in terms of their inputs, outputs, processes, user interfaces, datastores, hardware, and software. How are the systems alike? How do they differ?

Kudos for identifying the lowest-tech and most-unique systems.
