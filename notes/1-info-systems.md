# Introduction to Information Systems

## Definition

An Information System processes information inputs into outputs for a specific purpose.

A system may process different kinds of information, according into the following hierarchy:

information term | meaning | example
--- | --- | ---
**data** | a description of something, not necessarily organized or synthesized to provide meaning | numbers, words, dates, images, files
**information** | data that has been organized to provide meaning and value. requires interpretation. | a data visualization or chart which depicts sales over time
**knowledge** | data and/or information that has been organized and processed and interpreted to convey understanding, experience, accumulated learning, expertise, etc. | an informed decision to raise prices based on market conditions.

Information Systems may or may not leverage technology.

A computer-based Information System uses a related group of computer components
 working together to process information inputs into information outputs
 for a specific purpose.

### Components

Components of a computer-based IS generally include:

 + hardware
 + software
 + network
 + datastore
 + people
 + procedures/instructions

### Capabilities

Information Systems can perform numeric computations,
 facilitate communication and collaboration,
 automate business processes, and more.

### Classifications

An Information System may be classified into one or more general types
 based on its main purpose and functions,
 as well as the type of information it processes,
 and the audience it serves.

system type | general functions | example(s)
--- | --- | ---
Operational (e.g. Transaction Processing, Office Support) | send and receive data | online food ordering, payroll processing
Managerial (e.g. Business Intelligence, Decision Support) | process and synthesize data into information | business performance tracking dashboards
Executive (e.g. Decision Support, Expert) | process and synthesize data and information into knowledge; emulate human decision-making processes | language processing and translation, predictive modeling

## Advantages

Businesses use Information Systems to create and maintain a **competitive advantage**
 in terms of:

 + cost
 + quality
 + speed
 + accuracy
 + scale

## Planning and Management

Build vs Buy

Development Methodologies:

 + Waterfall/Traditional
 + Agile

### Systems Development Lifecycle:

 1. Requirements Gathering and Investigation
 * Analysis
 * Planning
 * Design
 * Programming and Testing
 * Implementation
 * Operation and Maintenance
