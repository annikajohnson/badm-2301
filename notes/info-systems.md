# Introduction to Information Systems

## Definition

An Information System processes information inputs into outputs for a specific purpose.

A system may process different kinds of information, according into the following hierarchy:

information term | meaning | example
--- | --- | ---
**Data** | A description of something, not necessarily organized or synthesized to provide meaning. | numbers, words, dates, images, files
**Information** | Data that has been organized or interpreted to provide meaning and value. | a chart depicting sales over time
**Knowledge** | Data and/or Information that has been organized, processed and interpreted to convey understanding, experience, accumulated learning, expertise, etc. | an informed decision to raise marketing expenditure levels

Information Systems may or may not leverage technology.

A computer-based Information System uses
 a related group of computer components working together
 to process information inputs into information outputs
 for a specific purpose.

### Components

Components of a computer-based IS generally include:

 + hardware
 + software
 + network
 + datastore
 + people
 + procedures/instructions

### Capabilities

Information Systems can perform numeric computations,
 facilitate communication and collaboration,
 automate business processes, and more.

### Classifications

An Information System may be classified into one or more general types
 based on its main purpose and functions,
 as well as the type of information it processes,
 and the audience it serves.

system type | general functions | example(s)
--- | --- | ---
Operational | Sends and receives data. | Online Ordering, Payroll Processing, ATMs, Transaction Processing, Office Support
Managerial | Processes and synthesizes data into information. | Performance Dashboard, Business Intelligence, Decision Support
Executive | Processes and synthesizes information into knowledge; emulates **human** decision-making and judgement processes. | Decision Support, Expert, Machine Learning, GW Housing Selection

## Advantages

Businesses use Information Systems to create and maintain a **competitive advantage**
 in terms of:

 + cost
 + quality
 + speed
 + accuracy
 + scale

## Planning and Management
